In this quick project, I created a webapp that lets you pull up the weather for any city you want to, chiefly to practice using API calls and asynchronous functions.
You can choose whether to display the temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, and a gif is shown based on the weather.
The weather data is acquired via https://openweathermap.org/api and the gifs via https://developers.giphy.com/.
